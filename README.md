## Overview
In a group setting build a full stack application using **_Java, Spring MVC, and JPA_**. This project includes a fully developed database schema, C.R.U.D., user logins authenticated by a mySQL table with different types of users having different permissions, and implementation of a session object.

## Description
**_EventLight_** is an application that displays different events at different venues. Venue owners can sign up and add their venue, as well as events to their venues, bands for that event, and artists for those bands. They also have the ability to update and delete events associated with their venue. Attendee accounts can be created by a user, and the user can favorite select events and see those events on their home page. Non logged in users can see a list of all events and information pages related to events, venues, bands, and artists.
An already build out venue account can be accessed with the following log in credentials:
- username: Gary 
- password: 1234

An already build out user account can be accessed with the following log in credentials:
- username: attendee
- password: 1234

Feel free to create your own account at the level of your choosing.

## Lessons Learned
- This project solidifed our confidence in the information being taught to us. The things we felt like we didn't know very well, we learned that we actually know and were able to implement things with ease. We learned how to use a table composed of only two foriegn keys from two other tables and how to make that data properly correlate. 

## Stretch Goals
- Adding the feature for users to comment on events and interact with one another.
